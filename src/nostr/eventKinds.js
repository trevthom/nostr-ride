//  NOSTR EVENT KINDS — The "type" number on every Nostr event.
//  These are how the app tells a ride request apart from an offer.
//  Kind 0 is the Nostr standard for profiles; the 30078+ numbers
//  are in Nostr's "addressable" range.
//
//  IMPORTANT: kind numbers like 30078 (NIP-78) are ALSO used by other
//  Nostr apps on the public relays. So every event this app publishes
//  also carries an app tag (["t", APP_TAG]) and we filter relay reads
//  to that tag — otherwise we'd ingest unrelated apps' events (whose
//  content isn't our JSON) and crash when parsing them.
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// Distinguishes this app's events from other apps sharing the same kinds.
